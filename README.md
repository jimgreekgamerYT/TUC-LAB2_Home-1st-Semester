This is the second exercise that you get from Introduction to Programming in the Technical University of Crete.

You have to create a program that calculates and shows the Discomfort Index ( DI ) and shows text that represents that number. Additional exercise is to make the program run with Fahrenheit and calculate the number that it needs so the comfort is ideal.
